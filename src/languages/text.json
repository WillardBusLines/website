      "For 55 years, Willard Bus Lines has provided school transportation services to the school boards of North Eastern Ontario. Our strong community roots and excellent safety record reflect our deep commitment to these schools and families.\n\nWillard Bus Lines is a family owned and operated business that is proudly 100% Canadian. We have serviced Temiskaming Shores and area since 1961, when the company was founded by Glen Willard & Alex Little.\n\nCurrently, Willard Bus Lines is owned and operated by Terry and Jeff Willard who are long-term residents of the community. Together, with the rest of the staff, they are committed to supporting local schools, businesses, community projects and neighbours.\n\nCommunity support has been given in the form of free bussing for certain school and church outings and in contributions to community based fundraising projects.\n\nWe are passionate about teaching our students to stay safe. We believe that school bus drivers make an impact in a child’s life. We are the first ones students see in the morning and the last ones they see before they go home. Student safety training happens every day, every route and every time a student is in the care of one of our drivers.\n\nOur experienced staff and quality fleet allows us to safely get you where you need to go."

      "In 1961 Glen Willard & Alex Little began “Willard and Little Bus Lines”. They started out by serving the local community of Kerns Township with only 2 buses. As the years went on, the business expanded to serve a larger area and the fleet grew to 8 buses.\n\nEventually, Glen took over sole ownership of the company and he enlisted the help of his kids to help it thrive, truly making it a family run business. Early on, his eldest son Wes, who was a teacher at NLPS, managed the bookwork division and is still called upon now for his experience in the field. In 1990, Glen had his eye on retirement and decided to pass on the company to two of his other sons, Terry & Jeff.\n\nTerry overtook the day-to-day operations, while Jeff managed the service/maintenance side of the business. Currently, our service area extends from Temagmi to Kirkland Lake, and we have grown to 46 bus routes. With this success, more help was needed, and it only seemed fitting that more family would fill those roles. Terry’s wife, Susan, and Jeff’s wife, Keetha are now integral members in the office.\n\nSince the inception of Willard Bus Lines Inc. Glen’s motto was \"It's for the kids\". We have stood by this ideal, and truly believe that school bus drivers have an impact in a child’s life.\n\n2016 marks our 55th year in business, and we plan to maintain the same level of quality service that we have provided for so long."
